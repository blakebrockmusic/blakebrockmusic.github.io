      </h4>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-1">Blake is a Florida native that has lived and traveled around the country, as a performing artist. Upon receiving his first guitar on his 13th birthday, his original sound didnâ€™t begin to really develop until late high school.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-1">Delving into the sounds of John Mayer, and artists alike, Blake has developed a sound that is an interesting mix of genres such as: singer-songwriter, synth-pop, indie-alternative, etc. Modeling sounds similar to the styles of LANY, The 1975, John Mayer, Leon Bridges, City and Colour, and much more, Blake has definitely found a unique sound that is timeless, modern, and original.</p>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-1">Blake and his band currently perform in the Birmingham area, while occasionally traveling to Auburn, northern Alabama cities, Florida, and other areas.</p>
